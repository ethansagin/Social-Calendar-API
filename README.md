# README
Welcome to the React Social Calendar, your one-stop-shop for all of your social scheduling needs! This is Ethan Sagin's final project for the Flatiron Bootcamp, it was built witha React/Redux front-end and a Ruby-on-Rails API back-end.

The app serves as a social calendar through which you can track your past meetups and schedule future ones with your friends. You can set a monthly interval of how often you would like to see friend, and the app will alert you if you are overdue to schedule a meetup within that interval. Additionally, the Upcoming page will list friends' meetups and birthdays that are scheduled for the immediate future, as well as list any friends with whom you have yet to schedule your next meetup.
